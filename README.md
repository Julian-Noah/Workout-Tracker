# Workout Tracker 💪

This is my second independent project built during my web development journey with Scrimba. A simple workout tracker to count and save your sets at the gym — built for flexibility when the gym is busy and you need to adjust your plan on the fly.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** - For the structure of the app
- **CSS3** - For styling and layout
- **JavaScript** - For the interactive counter logic

## 🧠 What I focused on in this project:

- **DOM Manipulation:** Using `document.getElementById` and `.textContent` to dynamically update the UI
- **Functions:** Writing reusable functions like `increment()`, `save()` and `reset()` to handle user interactions
- **Event Handling:** Connecting buttons to functions via `onclick`
- **State Management:** Tracking the current count with a variable and updating it across functions
- **Flexbox:** Centering all elements cleanly with `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column`

## 🚀 Upcoming Features

- Decrement button to correct mistakes
- Separate save history per exercise
- Mobile responsiveness
